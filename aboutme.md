As a Data Scientist with a M.S. degree in Statistical Science from Duke University, I am very passionate about data science and artificial intelligence. I like reading and discussing about how data science and technologies are changing our world. I also enjoy working on data science projects to hone my skills of R and python (please check [**"projects"**](https://mingjiezhao.github.io/projects/) for more details).

In addition to my full-time job as a Data Scientist, I am a **free-lance writer** who enjoys sharing my DS experiences by telling data stories, providing tips and insights with best practices. I am an official author of [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/). My blogs are usually published here first on my web, but you could also read them from my [**Medium page**](https://mingjie-zhao.medium.com/), please remember to "clap" for my stories if you enjoy them!

With my academic background in architectural engineering, I'd love to keep my connections to the **energy industry and building industry**. I work as a **professional Data Science Consultant** for clients in the industries (for example, [Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute](https://www.ahrinet.org/home)), and I also provide **free DS consulting sessions** to people who are making efforts for a better energy future (please check ["Consulting Services"](https://mingjiezhao.github.io/ConsultingServices/) for details).

I am an active person who enjoys working out and outdoor activities such as hiking and paddle boarding. I have visited more than 20 national parks and there are more on my list. When I have free time, I enjoy working out in the gym, watching comedy movies and reading novels. I also love musical shows and museums.

I have a 6-year old chihuahua named Lilly, who is a fan of hiking with me in the woods. I have lived in 7 states (PA, WA, NY, VA, OR, NC, GA) in the U.S. As a passionate traveler, I have driven across the country from east coast to west coast twice. I plan to visit all the states and so far have been to over 30 states.

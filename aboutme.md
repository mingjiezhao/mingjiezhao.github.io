As a Data Scientist with a M.S. degree in Statistical Science from Duke University, I am very passionate about data science and artificial intelligence. I like reading and discussing about how data science and technologies are changing our world. I also enjoy working on data science projects to hone my skills of R and python (please check ["projects"](https://mingjiezhao.github.io/projects/) for more details).

I am an active person who enjoys working out and outdoor activities such as hiking and paddle boarding. I have visited more than 20 national parks and there are more on my list. When I have free time, I enjoy working out in the gym, watching comedy movies and reading novels. I also love musical shows and museums.

I have a 5-year old chihuahua named Lilly, who is a fan of hiking with me in the woods. I have lived in 7 states (PA, WA, NY, VA, OR, NC, GA) in the U.S. As a passionate traveler, I have driven across the country from east coast to west coast twice. I plan to visit all the states and so far have been to over 30 states.

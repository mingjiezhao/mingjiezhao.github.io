## Connecting the energy industry with data science

### Why?
The energy industry is dealing with massive datasets with all kinds of format. Buildings, electricity infrastructure, renewable energy systems generate data and thus created a lot of opportunities in terms of turning the energy data into insights, research projects, and business values.  

That's where the Data Science comes in. With 8 years of extensive experiences in conducting energy and building related research and projects, I am excited to serve the energy industry as a Data Science Consultant.

No matter if you are a professor working on a research project, a stakeholder who is trying to create energy data products, a building manager who wants to identify building operation issues through data, or a student who is struggling with analysis of a big energy dataset, I am here to help.

### What is the cost?
Most importantly, this consultancy is totally #FREE#. I hope to utilize my background in both engineering and statistics to do the volunteer work and contribute to a greener energy future.
